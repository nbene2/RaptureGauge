# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: API Key Setup

## Your OpenAI Key is Configured ‚úÖ

I've added your OpenAI API key to the app configuration.

## You Still Need a NewsAPI Key! üî¥

To complete the setup, you need to get a **FREE** NewsAPI key:

1. **Go to:** https://newsapi.org/register
2. **Sign up** (takes 30 seconds)
3. **Get your API key** (looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6...`)
4. **Add it to the app** in one of these ways:

### Option 1: Add to Config File (Easiest)
Edit `/RaptureGauge/Configuration/APIConfig.swift`:
```swift
static let newsAPI = "YOUR_KEY_HERE" // Add your NewsAPI key
```

### Option 2: Add in App Settings
1. Run the app
2. Go to Settings tab
3. Enter your NewsAPI key
4. Tap "Save API Keys Securely"

## Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Your OpenAI key is currently stored in the config file
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For production use, delete the key from APIConfig.swift after first run
- ‚úÖ Keys are moved to secure iOS Keychain after first launch
- ‚úÖ The .gitignore prevents committing keys to git

## Test Your Setup

1. Open Xcode:
   ```bash
   open /Users/bened/Documents/nvb_rapt/RaptureGauge/RaptureGauge.xcodeproj
   ```

2. Press ‚åòR to run

3. The app will:
   - Auto-configure your OpenAI key
   - Prompt for NewsAPI key if missing
   - Start fetching and analyzing news
